# LiberSMS
LiberSMS is a python program that sends Liber Resh vel Helios SMS reminder messages at accurate times (4 times a day) based on your location.  This program uses the Twilio API to send SMS messages to users based on phone numbers and locations stored in a SQLite3 database.  This program has been tested on PythonAnywhere for several months, running as a daily task, and works as designed.  

**Idea:** LiberSMS was created to run on a server and provide daily text reminders to the creator to perform Liber Resh vel Helios at the correct times based on location.  The idea was for LiberSMS to eventually be a service with a front end signup for users to get LiberSMS messages daily.  As of today, the front-end has not been implemented.

**What is Liber Resh vel Helios?:** 
Liber Resh vel Helios (aka Liber CC or Liber 200), as written by Aleister Crowley, briefly instructs a participant to verbally and physically “greet”
the sun four times daily (at sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight) facing one of each cardinal directions toward the sun (East, South, West, and North
respectively). 

**Updates needed:**  
<li>Front-end sign-up system</li>
