# LiberSMS
LiberSMS is a python program that sends Liber Resh vel Helios Text (SMS) reminder messages at accurate times based on your location.  This program uses the Twilio API to send SMS messages to users based on phone numbers and locations stored in a SQLite3 database.  This program has been tested for months on PythonAnywhere, and was created to eventually be a service with a front end signup for users to get LiberSMS messages.

**What is Liber Resh vel Helios?:** 
Liber Resh vel Helios (aka Liber CC or Liber 200), as written by Aleister Crowley, briefly instructs a participant to verbally and physically “greet”
the sun four times daily (at sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight) facing one of each cardinal directions toward the sun (East, South, West, and North
respectively).
